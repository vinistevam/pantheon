# Getting started overview

You can get started with Pantheon by:

* Starting a node as described in [Starting Pantheon](Starting-Pantheon.md)
* Running from the [Pantheon Docker image](Run-Docker-Image.md)
* Using the [Private Network Quickstart](../Tutorials/Private-Network-Quickstart.md) 

To run a single node to connect the Ethereum mainnet or a public testnet, running from the Pantheon [Docker image](Run-Docker-Image.md) or [installing the packaged binaries](../Installation/Install-Binaries.md) is the fastest way to get started. 

To run a private network on which you can make JSON-RPC requests and send transactions, or explore Pantheon and a private Ethereum network, the [Private Network Quickstart](../Tutorials/Private-Network-Quickstart.md) runs a private network of Pantheon nodes in Docker containers.
