### Breaking Changes to Command Line

Breaking changes have been made to the command line options in v0.9 to improve usability. Many v0.8 command line options no longer work. 

The [documentation](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/) has been updated throughout to use the changed command line options and the [command line reference](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Reference/Pantheon-CLI-Syntax/) documents the changed options.

## 0.8.4

### Docker Image

If you have been running a node using the v0.8.3 Docker image, the node was not saving data to the 
specified [data directory](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Getting-Started/Run-Docker-Image/#data-directory),
or referring to the custom [configuration file](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Getting-Started/Run-Docker-Image/#custom-configuration-file)
or [genesis file](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Getting-Started/Run-Docker-Image/#custom-genesis-file). 

To recover the node key and data directory from the Docker container:
`docker cp <container>:/opt/pantheon/key <destination_file>`
`docker cp <container>:/opt/pantheon/database <destination_directory>` 

Where `container` is the name or ID of the Docker container containing the Pantheon node. 

The container can be running or stopped when you copy the key and data directory. If your node was 
fully synchronized to MainNet, the data directory will be ~2TB.  

When restarting your node with the v0.8.4 Docker image:

* Save the node key in the [`key` file](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Configuring-Pantheon/Node-Keys/#node-private-key) in the data 
    directory or specify the location using the [`--node-private-key` option](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Configuring-Pantheon/Node-Keys/#specifying-a-custom-node-private-key-file).  
* Specify the `<destination_directory` as a [volume for the data directory](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Getting-Started/Run-Docker-Image/#data-directory).

## 0.8.3 

### Breaking Change to JSON RPC-API 

From v0.8.3, incoming HTTP requests are only accepted from hostnames specified using the `--host-whitelist` command-line option. If not specified, the default value for `--host-whitelist` is `localhost`. 

If using the URL `http://127.0.0.1` to make JSON-RPC calls, use `--host-whitelist` to specify the hostname `127.0.0.1` or update the hostname to `localhost`. 

If your application publishes RPC ports, specify the hostnames when starting Pantheon. For example:  

```json
pantheon --host-whitelist=example.com
```
 
Specify `*` or `all` for `--host-whitelist` to effectively disable host protection and replicate pre-v0.8.3 behavior. This is not recommended for production code.
